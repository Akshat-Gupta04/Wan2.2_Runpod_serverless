Replace `<version>` with the current release tag, check the [releases page](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-comfyui/releases) for the latest version.

## API Specification

The worker exposes standard RunPod serverless endpoints (`/run`, `/runsync`, `/health`). By default, videos are returned as base64 strings. You can configure the worker to upload videos to an S3 bucket instead by setting specific environment variables (see [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md)).

Use the `/runsync` endpoint for synchronous requests that wait for the job to complete and return the result directly. Use the `/run` endpoint for asynchronous requests that return immediately with a job ID; you'll need to poll the `/status` endpoint separately to get the result.

**Note**: Video generation typically takes longer than image generation, so consider using the `/run` endpoint for asynchronous processing.

### Input

```json
{
  "input": {
    "workflow": {
      "6": {
        "inputs": {
          "text": "The white dragon warrior stands still, eyes full of determination and strength. The camera slowly moves closer or circles around the warrior, highlighting the powerful presence and heroic spirit of the character.",
          "clip": ["38", 0]
        },
        "class_type": "CLIPTextEncode",
        "_meta": {
          "title": "CLIP Text Encode (Positive Prompt)"
        }
      },
      "62": {
        "inputs": {
          "image": "input_image.jpg"
        },
        "class_type": "LoadImage",
        "_meta": {
          "title": "LoadImage"
        }
      }
    },
    "images": [
      {
        "name": "input_image.jpg",
        "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The following tables describe the fields within the `input` object:

| Field Path       | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `input`          | Object | Yes      | Top-level object containing request data.                                                                                                  |
| `input.workflow` | Object | Yes      | The ComfyUI workflow exported in the [required format](#getting-the-workflow-json).                                                        |
| `input.images`   | Array  | Yes      | Array of input images for I2V generation. Each image is uploaded to ComfyUI's `input` directory and referenced by its `name` in the workflow. |

#### `input.images` Object

Each object within the `input.images` array must contain:

| Field Name | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`     | String | Yes      | Filename used to reference the image in the workflow (e.g., via a "LoadImage" node). Must be unique within the array.            |
| `image`    | String | Yes      | Base64 encoded string of the image. A data URI prefix (e.g., `data:image/jpeg;base64,`) is optional and will be handled correctly. |

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Size Limits:** RunPod endpoints have request size limits (e.g., 10MB for `/run`, 20MB for `/runsync`). Large base64 input images can exceed these limits. See [RunPod Docs](https://docs.runpod.io/docs/serverless-endpoint-urls).

### Output

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Breaking Change in Output Format (5.0.0+)**
>
> Versions `< 5.0.0` returned the primary image data (S3 URL or base64 string) directly within an `output.message` field.
> Starting with `5.0.0`, the output format has changed significantly, see below

```json
{
  "id": "sync-uuid-string",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "output": {
    "images": [
      {
        "filename": "ComfyUI_00001_.mp4",
        "type": "base64",
        "data": "AAAAIGZ0eXBpc29tAAACAGlzb21pc28yYXZjMW1wNDE..."
      }
    ]
  },
  "delayTime": 123,
  "executionTime": 4567
}
```

| Field Path      | Type             | Required | Description                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `output`        | Object           | Yes      | Top-level object containing the results of the job execution.                                               |
| `output.images` | Array of Objects | No       | Present if the workflow generated videos. Contains a list of objects, each representing one output video.   |
| `output.errors` | Array of Strings | No       | Present if non-fatal errors or warnings occurred during processing (e.g., S3 upload failure, missing data). |

#### `output.images`

Each object in the `output.images` array has the following structure:

| Field Name | Type   | Description                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `filename` | String | The original filename assigned by ComfyUI during generation (typically .mp4 or .gif).          |
| `type`     | String | Indicates the format of the data. Either `"base64"` or `"s3_url"` (if S3 upload is configured). |
| `data`     | String | Contains either the base64 encoded video string or the S3 URL for the uploaded video file.      |

> [!NOTE]
> The `output.images` field provides a list of all generated videos (the field name is kept for backward compatibility).
>
> - If S3 upload is **not** configured (default), `type` will be `"base64"` and `data` will contain the base64 encoded video string.
> - If S3 upload **is** configured, `type` will be `"s3_url"` and `data` will contain the S3 URL. See the [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md#example-s3-response) for an S3 example response.
> - Clients interacting with the API need to handle this list-based structure under `output.images`.

## Usage

To interact with your deployed RunPod endpoint:

1.  **Get API Key:** Generate a key in RunPod [User Settings](https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless/user/settings) (`API Keys` section).
2.  **Get Endpoint ID:** Find your endpoint ID on the [Serverless Endpoints](https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless/user/endpoints) page or on the `Overview` page of your endpoint.

### Generate Image (Sync Example)

Send a workflow to the `/runsync` endpoint (waits for completion). Replace `<api_key>` and `<endpoint_id>`. The `-d` value should contain the [JSON input described above](#input).

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":{"workflow":{... your workflow JSON ...}}}' \
  https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<endpoint_id>/runsync
```

You can also use the `/run` endpoint for asynchronous jobs and then poll the `/status` to see when the job is done. Or you [add a `webhook` into your request](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/endpoints/send-requests#webhook-notifications) to be notified when the job is done.

Refer to [`test_input.json`](./test_input.json) for a complete input example.

## Getting the Workflow JSON

To get the correct `workflow` JSON for the API:

1.  Open ComfyUI in your browser.
2.  In the top navigation, select `Workflow > Export (API)`
3.  A `workflow.json` file will be downloaded. Use the content of this file as the value for the `input.workflow` field in your API requests.
